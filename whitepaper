CoinCapsule White Paper
Overview
CoinCapsule is an innovative Ethereum-based ERC20 token that serves as a versatile container for managing digital assets. Each token represents a virtual wallet, capable of securely holding and managing ETH, ERC20, and ERC721 tokens. CoinCapsule introduces a novel approach to asset management, combining security, flexibility, and ease of use within a decentralized framework.

Key Features
Fixed Supply and Decimals: The CoinCapsule token has a maximum supply of 13,000,000,000 tokens and operates with zero decimals, meaning each token is indivisible.
Minting Mechanism: Users can mint up to 100 tokens at a time by paying a fixed minting fee of 0.00005 ETH per token. Minting is restricted by the maximum supply and each minted token corresponds to the creation of a new virtual wallet.
Wallet Functionality: Each CoinCapsule token functions as a unique wallet, allowing users to deposit and withdraw ETH, ERC20 tokens, and ERC721 tokens. Wallets are secured by the owner and can be frozen or unfrozen using a password mechanism.
Security and Ownership: The contract leverages the OpenZeppelin libraries for security, including reentrancy protection and ownership control. Wallets can be transferred between users, maintaining the integrity and security of the contents.
Fee Vault: A separate fee vault contract is used to collect minting fees, ensuring transparency and security in the fee management process.
Token and Wallet Mechanics
Minting Tokens
Users can mint new CoinCapsule tokens by paying the associated minting fee. Upon minting, each token is linked to a newly created virtual wallet, which the user can label for easy identification. The total supply of CoinCapsule tokens is capped at 13 billion, ensuring scarcity.

Wallet Management
Each CoinCapsule token represents a virtual wallet with the following functionalities:

ETH Deposits and Withdrawals: Users can deposit and withdraw ETH into their wallets, with all transactions being recorded on-chain.
ERC20 and ERC721 Support: The wallet supports the deposit and withdrawal of both ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, making it versatile for managing various digital assets.
Wallet Freezing and Unfreezing: Wallets can be frozen by the owner using a password mechanism, preventing any transactions until the wallet is unfrozen with the correct password.
Labeling: Users can assign labels to their wallets for better organization and management.
Security and Compliance
CoinCapsule employs several security features to protect users' assets:

Reentrancy Guard: The contract uses OpenZeppelinâ€™s ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks, ensuring secure transaction processing.
Ownable: The contract ownership is controlled via the Ownable mechanism, allowing the contract's deployer to manage key functions securely.
SafeERC20: For ERC20 token management, the contract utilizes the SafeERC20 library, providing safe operations for token transfers.
Fee Management
The contract includes a dedicated fee vault (FeeCollectingVault) to collect minting fees. This vault is managed separately, with only the owner having the authority to withdraw collected fees. The transparent and secure handling of fees ensures trust and reliability in the CoinCapsule ecosystem.

Use Cases
Secure Asset Management: CoinCapsule provides a secure and flexible way for users to manage multiple types of digital assets within a single tokenized wallet.
Gifting and Transfers: The ability to transfer entire wallets, including their contents, makes CoinCapsule an ideal solution for gifting digital assets or securely transferring ownership.
DeFi Integration: With its support for multiple token standards, CoinCapsule can be integrated into various DeFi platforms, offering enhanced asset management features.
Conclusion
CoinCapsule is a pioneering solution in the blockchain space, offering a unique combination of asset management, security, and user control. Its robust feature set, underpinned by strong security practices, positions it as a valuable tool for anyone looking to manage digital assets in a decentralized manner.

By focusing on user empowerment and security, CoinCapsule aims to become a standard in the world of digital asset management, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi).
